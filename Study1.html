                <p>
                    The team completed a competitive analysis and found that there is currently no mobile app dedicated to receiving customized and factual local news. Existing apps are either focused on national news, or show irrelevant, opinion-based information for communities. theSkimm and Apple News send notifications about news in almost real-time but is not customizable, or locally focused. Nextdoor is a local app that allows anyone to post based on your neighborhood, but is more often used to report lost pets, sell items or other non-news postings. Meetup can be used to notify users of gatherings or demonstrations but does not have articles and is mainly used for quick social updates.

            <p>
                After taking ideas from our sketches, we created digital wireframes, talking through each decision as a team. This conversational design process allowed for us to share ideas on where items should be placed and overall feature designing. We played around with the structure of the design and made many changes to allow for information to be accessible in a way that the user can see what they are looking for without scrolling or making too many clicks. We also replaced small buttons with tabs to chunk the data into related groups.

As designers, we feel that each step in the process helped us get outside of our own heads, and contributed in some way to the shape our prototype eventually took.
